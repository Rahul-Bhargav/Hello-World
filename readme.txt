thus is just an introduction to git

this is the first change in the file



Notice the lack of t_Co or g:solarized_termcolors settings. These should both be unnecessary in either of these terminals. I’ve set both apps to use Consolas 13pt. font. Notice that considerably more lines of text are visible in iTerm2. It looks like iTerm2's line height is considerably shorter. Whether this is good or bad is a matter of taste.

It’s already in the nightly builds of iTerm2. This means we’ll be able to have full GUI-like colors in vim (once vim supports it too), thus effectively outmoding MacVim for me. But, the nightly builds are very unstable (as they should be), so this is a feature worth waiting for.
iTerm2 has a built-in keyboard shortcut to go to its window. Very convenient! You can do the same by creating an Automator script for Terminal, but it’s a pain.
It’s a lot more customizable. For example, I can tell it to shut up and never show me warning dialogues when I’m closing a tab or quitting the app when there’s a running process. Customizability ends up being pretty important for serious developers who are always in the terminal.
iTerm2’s jump to cursor feature can be very helpful. When you just get back to the screen, rather than darting around with your eyes to look for the cursor, you can easily bring attention to it.
iTerm2 has mouse support. Although I’ve mostly got my hands on the keyboard, there are times when it’s nice to select cursor position or selection with the mouse. For example, this is nice for scrolling through and selecting text in tmux bash history, which can’t be done with the mouse in Terminal.app.
After using the two for a while, I think drawings (text as well as lines, etc.) look sharper in iTerm2.
